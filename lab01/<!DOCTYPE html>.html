    <body>My name is Xingjian Murong a student from China, my major is information management, To be honest, I don't like programming very much, but I think this skill can give me more opportunities, which is also the reason why I choose this major. My hobbies are playing football and modifying my own car. Finally, I run a tiktok account with 200,000 followers in China, and I hope my major can help me with this.
